This project wrangled and analyzed WeRateDogs (@dog_rates) twitter data to gain insights on names, ratings, and possible relationships between ratings and combined retweet and favorite/like counts.  

## Primary Objectives
The main goal of the project was to wrangle data effectively so that insights could be drawn and a 
visualization prepared. Three sources of data were used, and wrangling was carried out in 3 steps:
 
* Gathering – this step entailed collecting an “on-hand” file and a downloadable file from 
Udacity, while the third source of data was Twitter itself which was accessed via API. 
 
* Assessing – after gathering, the data was given a high-level review and any peculiarities or 
issues were recorded. Issues fell into one of two groups, Quality or Tidiness. 
 
* Cleaning – post assessment, the datasets were wrangled to fix the issues and allow the data to be used for analysis and visualization.

## References
* Udacity curriculum and starter notebooks.
* Twitter API Tweepy documentation.
* Additional references included in notebook.
